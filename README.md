Bisecting K-Means Algorithm:


This project presents a novel method for enhancing nearest neighbor classification speed by employing bisecting k-means clustering to select representative prototypes from the training set.
I define prototype effectiveness through intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation, formalizing these properties for automatic se-lection. The implemented algorithm demonstrates improved test accuracy on the MNIST dataset using 1-NN classification.
